# Machine Learning Project - Price Prediction Model Solution

This is a solution to the price prediction project, wherein we were supposed to implement machine learning models and optimise them to obtain a model which predicts price with increased accuracy.

- Pandas
- 
### What I learned
Learnt to implement various machine learning models from scratch, their mathematical working and the nitty-gritties behind them (LinearRegression, RandomForest, DecisionTrees, K-NearestNeighbours algorithm) & how these algorithms can be optimised to increase their performance various techniques such as pruning, filtering, hyperparameter tuning.
